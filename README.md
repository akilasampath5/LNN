# Logical Neural Networks
LNNs are a novel `Neuro = Symbolic` framework designed to seamlessly provide key
properties of both neural nets (learning) and symbolic logic (knowledge and reasoning).

- Every neuron has a meaning as a component of a formula in a weighted
  real-valued logic, yielding a highly interpretable disentangled representation.
- Inference is omnidirectional rather than focused on predefined target
  variables, and corresponds to logical reasoning, including classical
  first-order logic theorem proving as a special case.
- The model is end-to-end differentiable, and learning minimizes a novel loss
  function capturing logical contradiction, yielding resilience to inconsistent
  knowledge.
- It also enables the open-world assumption by maintaining bounds on truth values
  which can have probabilistic semantics, yielding resilience to incomplete
  knowledge.

## Quickstart
To install the LNN:

1. Make sure that the python version you use in line with our [setup](https://github.com/IBM/LNN/blob/master/setup.py) file, using a fresh environment is always a good idea:
    ```commandline
    conda create -n lnn python=3.9 -y
    conda activate lnn
    ```
2. Install the `master` branch to keep up to date with the latest supported features:
    ```commandline
    pip install git+https://github.com/IBM/LNN
    ```
